## The Leap from Intern to MTS-1 at Fyle: My Journey ðŸš€

Hello, tech enthusiasts and aspiring developers! ðŸ‘‹

Hopefully, you have jumped onto this repo after reading my [Internship-Journey](https://github.com/SahilK-027/Internship-Journey-Fyle-2024) if not I highly recommend going through that journey first.

So, Fasten your seatbelts as I take you through my exciting leap from an intern to a full-time MTS-1 (Member of Technical Staff) at Fyle. This journey isnâ€™t just about learning to code better but evolving as a developer, teammate, and problem-solver in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. As I like to mention this is not just a README; it's a living document, a story in progress. Join me as I navigate the challenges, celebrate victories, and immerse myself in the world of pixels and protocols.

Buckle up, fellow coders! The journey begins here. Let the journey unfold! ðŸŒŸ

### ðŸŒ± From Internship to MTS1: Key Projects

During my internship at Fyle, I got the opportunity to work on a variety of impactful tasks that set the foundation for my role as an MTS1. I have worked on fixing numerous usability issues and bugs but here are some key projects I handled included:

- **StyleLint Upgrade Dependency**: I worked on upgrading the StyleLint dependency and documented the process as part of the infrastructure updates. This involved ensuring that the changes didnâ€™t break existing workflows and maintaining consistency in the codebase.
- **Date of Spend and Travel Field Name Issue**: This was an interesting challenge where I had to address discrepancies in field names for expenses, ensuring accurate data representation across the platform.
- **List View Alert Icons (Initiative 1)**: I contributed to an initiative that improved the alert icon visibility in list views, enhancing the user experience and making important notifications more accessible.
- **Projects API Migration (Initiative 2)**: A crucial part of my internship was working on migrating the Projects API, which included handling active categories in Quick Fyle. This task required a deep understanding of the system and collaboration with other teams to ensure a smooth transition.

Each of this initiative not only tested my technical skills but also gave me a chance to take ownership and contribute to real-world features. This experience laid the groundwork for my responsibilities as an MTS1, where the focus shifted from just implementing tasks to thinking holistically about the project, scalability, and future impact.
