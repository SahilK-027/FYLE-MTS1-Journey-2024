My Full-Time Journey at Fyle Inc. | MTS1 Role

## 🔹 The Leap from Intern to MTS-1 at Fyle: My Journey 🚀 (1st July 2024)

Hello, tech enthusiasts and aspiring developers! 👋

Hopefully, you have jumped onto this repo after reading my [Internship-Journey](https://github.com/SahilK-027/Internship-Journey-Fyle-2024) if not I highly recommend going through that journey first.

So, Fasten your seatbelts as I take you through my exciting leap from an intern to a full-time MTS-1 (Member of Technical Staff) at Fyle. This journey isn’t just about learning to code better but evolving as a developer, teammate, and problem-solver in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. As I like to mention this is not just a README; it's a living document, a story in progress. Join me as I navigate the challenges, celebrate victories, and immerse myself in the world of pixels and protocols.

Buckle up, fellow coders! The journey begins here. Let the journey unfold! 🌟

## 🔹 From Internship to MTS1: Key Projects 🌱 

During my internship at Fyle, I got the opportunity to work on a variety of impactful tasks that set the foundation for my role as an MTS1. I have worked on fixing numerous usability issues and bugs but here are some key projects I handled included:

- **StyleLint Upgrade Dependency**: I worked on upgrading the StyleLint dependency and documented the process as part of the infrastructure updates. This involved ensuring that the changes didn’t break existing workflows and maintaining consistency in the codebase.
- **Date of Spend and Travel Field Name Issue**: This was an interesting challenge where I had to address discrepancies in field names for expenses, ensuring accurate data representation across the platform.
- **List View Alert Icons (Initiative 1)**: I contributed to an initiative that improved the alert icon visibility in list views, enhancing the user experience and making important notifications more accessible.
- **Projects API Migration (Initiative 2)**: A crucial part of my internship was working on migrating the Projects API, which included handling active categories in Quick Fyle. This task required a deep understanding of the system and collaboration with other teams to ensure a smooth transition.

Each of these initiatives has not only tested my technical skills but also given me a chance to take ownership and contribute to real-world features. This experience laid the groundwork for my responsibilities as an MTS1, where the focus shifted from just implementing tasks to thinking holistically about the project, scalability, and future impact.

## 🔹 A Day in the Life of an MTS1 at Fyle 🌅
Ever wondered what it’s like to be an MTS1 at Fyle? Let me take you on a quick trip through a typical day—where ownership, problem-solving, and building something impactful are all in a day’s work.

 ### 🚀 10:30 AM - The Work Begins
> My day kicks off at around 10:30 AM. First things first—I review the tasks I wrapped up yesterday and see what’s still pending from the initiative milestones. This helps me plan the day effectively. I update our project management tools like ClickUp and Notion, where we track everything.
> As an MTS1, I’m responsible for certain features or bugs, which means I take full ownership. It’s not just about checking off tasks—it’s about making sure everything aligns, and if something's off, it’s my job to steer it back on course. Once that’s sorted, I sync up with the team to ensure all stakeholders are updated on progress.

### 🧪 11:00 AM - Testing Before Release
> Next up is testing. As we usually do patch releases or full push around 12:30 PM, I usually test my changes if there are any outgoing commits to prod added by me. I review the tests I’ve written and dive into making sure everything functions as expected before the release. It’s all about quality control—whether it’s running automated tests or manually checking for edge cases that could sneak past.

### 💻 12:00 PM - Deep Dive into Code
> After the testing phase, it’s time to get into the VS code. \This is where ownership really comes into play—it's not just about writing the code, but also making sure that what I build today can handle tomorrow's challenges. I take time to revisit initiative documentation and align it with any new changes.
> While coding, I also think about performance optimizations, scalability, and any potential edge cases that might crop up in the future. This is where I get to exercise my problem-solving skills to make sure the solution isn't just functional but future-proof.

### 📋 1:30 PM - Lunch Break
> After an intense morning 😂, it’s time for a well-deserved break. A good lunch, maybe a walk, some fun hobbies, and then back to business. Being an MTS1 means I need to stay sharp, so stepping away from the screen for a bit helps refresh my mind.

### 📝 2:30 PM - More code + Documentation + Sync-Ups
> I usually focus on writing a detailed technical spec for a new feature I am working on. This document lays out everything—API schemas, edge cases, testing strategies, and future-proofing plans. It’s not just a reference for the current project but a blueprint for anyone who works on it later.
> Some days I also hop on a couple of sync-up calls with the team. These meetings are where we coordinate with engineers and team members ensures everything is moving in the right direction.

### 🔧 3:30 PM - 6:00 PM - Focused Work: Code, Bugs, and More Code
> Afternoons are my most productive time. I’m either deep into fixing bugs or working on Initiative tasks. Each task requires a combination of attention to detail and a wider vision—how does this piece fit into the bigger picture?

### 🎯 6:30 PM - Wrapping Up
> As the day winds down, I document any important learnings or insights from the day’s work. If there were any blockers, I note them and start planning for the next day. It’s not just about getting things done—it’s about making sure the next day is set up for success.
> By the end of the day, I’ve usually touched multiple aspects—coding, testing, documentation, and collaboration. And even though each day has its unique challenges, the constant learning and ownership make it rewarding. That’s the life of an MTS1 at Fyle—driven by responsibility, collaboration, and building things that last.

## 🔹 Corporate Cards API Migration 💳 (25th July 2024)

This quarter, I’ve been working on the **Corporate Cards API Migration**. This initiative has been a deep dive into corporate card systems and has taught me a lot about both technology and documentation.

- **The Legendary ED Doc**: I started by writing a highly detailed ED (Engineering Design) document from scratch. This document has been invaluable throughout the project, serving as a reference for changes and guiding the implementation. This experience has taught me the importance of writing clear, detailed, and forward-thinking documentation.
- **Test Cases, Test Cases, and More Test Cases**: For every change, I wrote thorough test cases. Writing tests for every change isn’t glamorous, but it’s essential. Catching those bugs before they sneak in is its reward.

Throughout this initiative, I’ve learned so much about **VISA Nest, RTF, Virtual Cards**, and even how **Bank Statements** are handled. I also migrated APIs for **14 different actions**, and **reduced 10 redundant API calls**, all without a single P0 issue so far—feels like winning!!! This initiative has not only strengthened my technical skills but also sharpened my ability to handle complex migrations and work at scale.

Still, one task about exports from this initiative is pending, we are planning to release it in the next two weeks before declaring complete victory.

## 🔹 Move Reminder Dialog To FDL 🔔 (16th Oct 2024)
Currently, I'm working on migrating the **"Add Reminder" dialogue** to a new design that not only improves usability but also aligns with Fyle's fresh design standards. This initiative involves updating both the **Settings** and **Admin** personas, where the dialogue is displayed using `Angular.js`. With a fresh design from **Figma** to follow, the goal is to make this UI sleek, modern, and user-friendly.

### **Key Changes Involved:**

- **CSS Updates**: We’re updating margins, paddings, and font sizes to match the latest FDL specifications.
- **Layout Changes**: The form inputs, titles, and buttons will all get a facelift to follow new alignment rules.

The initiative itself has a relatively quick turnaround—**1 week** (as exports API migration is pending from the last initiative I will work on this for a week and then get back to exports API migration) to get through everything, including design doc writing, dev work, testing, and release!
