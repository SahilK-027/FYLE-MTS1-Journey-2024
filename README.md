## The Leap from Intern to MTS-1 at Fyle: My Journey ðŸš€

Hello, tech enthusiasts and aspiring developers! ðŸ‘‹

Hopefully, you have jumped onto this repo after reading my [Internship-Journey](https://github.com/SahilK-027/Internship-Journey-Fyle-2024) if not I highly recommend going through that journey first.

So, Fasten your seatbelts as I take you through my exciting leap from an intern to a full-time MTS-1 (Member of Technical Staff) at Fyle. This journey isnâ€™t just about learning to code better but evolving as a developer, teammate, and problem-solver in a fast-paced, dynamic environment. As I like to mention this is not just a README; it's a living document, a story in progress. Join me as I navigate the challenges, celebrate victories, and immerse myself in the world of pixels and protocols.

Buckle up, fellow coders! The journey begins here. Let the journey unfold! ðŸŒŸ
